## Hiring

The team and Board will seek to identify the need for new hires during the annual strategy and budget discussions. If funds are available or can be reasonably identified and the Board approves, the team will draft a job description. The board must approve the job status (team member vs. non-team member), job title, general responsibilities of the role, and salary range before the job description is made public. Once a job description goes out, the team is responsible for identifying candidates for interview and conducting first round interviews. We publicly announce all positions, rather than hiring exclusively through existing networks, to obtain a wide a field of candidates as possible.

### Hiring Team Members
Once 3-4 candidates are selected by the team, the application packages and notes are passed on to the Board. Interview packages should include:

 - Resume
 - Cover letter
 - Portfolio (if applicable)
 - Proposed salary and justification (mapped to open salary model)
 - Interview notes

The Board will then form a subcommittee of at least three Board members to interview the final candidates and review the open salary-model proposal assembled by the team. The Board will confer with team members and seek consensus, but ultimately it is the Board who has final say as to who to hire and and at what salary level. 

### Hiring Non-Team Members/Contractors
If funds and a job brief have been allocated for a contractor (non-team member) by the Board, then the team can proceed to hire whoever they see best fit without additional Board approval. In this case, the pay rate should be negotiated between the team and the contractor to ensure the task can be completed on time. 

### Onboarding
The goal of the onboarding process is to both welcome the new hire into the organization and help them take ownership in their role. P2PU maintains a Trello Board which includes various elements of the onboarding process. The first 90 days of employment will be an introductory period for new team members and P2PU to get acquainted with one another. New hires should not take on a leadership role in governance until at least 90 days have elapsed since the the hire date.
