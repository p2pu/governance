## Arbitration (Approved 9/15 by Board over email) 
Occasionally conflict will arise that cannot be solved by team members without an “independent” (not directly affected facilitator). In those cases, this four-step arbitration process can be used as a way to still leave a lot of responsibility in the hands of the team without getting stuck.

1. **Issue**: When we need to make a decision on a key issue, the team sets out the process and timeline to come up with a recommendation. The board can also request the team to find a solution to a particular issue and provide input on possible directions. A board facilitator is nominated by the board, who will participate in the process and represent it to the board. 
2. **Solution**: The team has an open discussion to identify the goals, bring out any issues that exist, try to resolve them, and come up with an agreed solution.
3. **Proposal**: During a review period, any team members can reach out to the board facilitator to raise additional points or make further suggestions they did not want to make in the group. This input can be treated confidential. The board facilitator takes the team solution, considers the additional input s/he received and prepares a joint proposal with the team for board review and approval.
4. **Board**: The issue is either shared with the board by email, or added to the agenda for the next board meeting. The board discusses the issue, considers the team solution, reviews additional input, may make further amendments, and approves (or denies) it.
