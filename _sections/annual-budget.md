## Annual budget
In or about September of each year, the Treasurer and team will put forward a draft budget for the next year. At or before the last Board meeting of each year, the Board should approve a budget for the following year. Approving a budget grants the team approval to incur the expenses in the budget with variances up to 5% per line item, unless such variance will reduce cash on hand to less than $50,000. The team should notify the Treasurer of such variations. 

Any larger variances or not previously approved expenses must be approved in advance by a simple majority of the Executive Committee, which shall be recorded in email and minuted at the next board meeting. An exception is made for expenses below $250 that are deemed important by the team but not previously approved by Board. These can be approved by the team and highlighted in the next Board meeting.
