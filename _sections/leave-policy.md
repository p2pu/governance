## Leave policy

We believe that a well rested team executes better and it is important for us to know that team members have the opportunity to tune out and switch off. We also believe that team members should have the autonomy to set their own schedules, while remaining responsible to the demands of the organization. Each team member is entitled to 15 days of leave per year (accrued at a rate of 1.25 days/month) plus 10 public holidays, aligning with the jurisdiction of residence. In addition, P2PU is closed the week between Dec 25 and January 1 (inclusive) and staff are not required to work that week.  In most cases, leave days can not be accrued.

Team members should notify the team as early as possible of their leave plans and should update the leave register accordingly, which feeds into the shared calendar. Additionally, if team members plan to take a leave of longer than one week, they should plan to discuss this with the rest of the team at least one month ahead of time to ensure that operations can continue in their absence. 

P2PU recognizes that there are additional types of leave that team members may want to take, including maternity/paternity leave, bereavement leave, and unpaid leave for other reasons. Any extended leave of greater than two weeks should be discussed with the team and elevated to the Board for feedback/input since each of these situations is unique.
