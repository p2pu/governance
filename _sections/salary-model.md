## Salary model (Approved 8/16 by Board over email)
We believe that people should be fairly compensated for the work they do, and that our compensation model should reflect a holistic view of our team. As such, the salary model is decided on collaboratively by the team, and approved by the Board. Our current salary model is comprised of four elements: a base salary, a location adjustment, a years-of-service bonus, and an adjustment for social costs depending on whether the team member is classified as an employee or consultant. Additionally, our model stipulates that nobody should earn more than twice as much as anybody else.

### The Process
There is an annual salary review in November or December of each year to affirm the model and allow team members or Board members to advocate for any changes, to be voted on by the Board. The process for this review is as follows:

1. Talk through the open compensation model as a team, identify what we need to address, and decide what we need to send to 3rd party (such as Board member) for review.
1. 3rd party consolidates different suggestions and makes a proposal to team.
1. Team has a second meeting to discuss the proposal and forwards the proposal to the Board.
1. Board approval or send back to team with comments.

Outside of that annual review, there are a few events that can trigger ad hoc adjustments:

 - If somebody moves, it is contingent on them to update their cost of living. Change to their salary is effective the first full month employee is in a new place.
 - When an employee hits a biennial anniversary and is eligible for a service round increase, it's their responsibility to make it an agenda item at the following Board meeting for discussion and approval by the Board.
