## How we work
We use 9-5 local time as a general reference for working hours, but there is a great deal of flexibility, as we are more concerned with getting the job done and making sure we’re staying connected to our colleagues and partners. If team members find themselves with less than 40 hours/week of work, they should speak up, as there may be opportunities to take on new responsibilities or reduce workload for a period of time. We work hard, and we trust that our teammates are working hard too. 

There are a number of tools and processes that we use to collaborate and remain transparent:

 - **Annual Meeting**: At least once per year we take a few hours to talk about our strategy, to make sure that we are all on board with our current strategy and progressing towards our goals. Whenever possible, we try do this face-to-face, usually surrounding an existing conference or project commitment that can bring as many team members and Board members together as possible.
 - **Board Meetings**: Team members will have a brief allotment of time to provide an update or ask questions to the Board during each Board meeting. They are encouraged to seek out Board member and community consultation outside of this time, as well. 
 - **Work in Progress**: Every six weeks, the team meets to set priorities for a six-week work cycle. This is designed to bridge long-term strategy with daily executive. Once a week, we meet to track our progress within the current WIP cycle. This is an opportunity to prioritize tasks and identify issues that we need to resolve.
 - **Stand Up**: We use Slack to share daily or weekly updates on what we’ve completed, what we’re working on, what we need help on. The stand up is framed around the Work In Progress.
