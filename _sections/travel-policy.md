## Travel policy

The distributed nature of our team and wide reach of our audience means that working for P2PU will involve some travel. All travel should demonstrate clear value for P2PU, such as executing project work, speaking at an event, or meeting new funders or partners. Incidental travel, side projects, and personal appearances are not eligible for approval. Furthermore, approval of travel does not necessarily mean approval of expenses. 

As a small nonprofit organization, we are committed to using our funding responsibly and expect team members to minimize costs whenever possible. All travel expenses must be paid directly from project funds, or else approved by the Board separately. 

### Process for approval
If a team member wishes to travel, they should estimate costs in the expense spreadsheet and send an email to the team seeking approval for the trip. If the trip is not directly tied to project work (e.g. flying to a workshop we’ve been paid to execute), then the team member should make a case for why this travel is important and justify the costs. A “yes” from all team members is required before signoff is possible.  P2PU will cover costs for the following expenses:

 - **Travel**: P2PU will cover air and ground transportation for business related travel (conferences, meetings, events with partners and funders, face-to-face meetups). P2PU expects all of its employees to use web-based price comparison services to research the best prices for rates and to choose low-cost tickets whenever possible. 
 - **Travel to/from airports**: Travel to and from airports is encouraged to be on public transportation or service operators (e.g. Super Shuttle). We don’t intend to pay for private transfer, unless it’s the only/most sensible option ( (e.g. it would require excessive time, or during very late or early hours).
 - **Accommodations**: Staff will stay in moderately priced accommodation, not to exceed $150/night (and usually much less). P2PU encourages employees to use homestays with friends and family when it is convenient. When using homestays, staff may be reimbursed up to $50 per visit for a thank you gift. 
 - **Additional costs**: 
     - Transportation to meetings, including subway or cab fare; 
     - The reproduction of materials needed for business meetings; 
     - Parking at airports where driving a personal car outweighs the overall cost or inconvenience of other transportation; 
     - Tolls; 
     - Meals for the staff member while traveling (up to $40/day; no alcohol); and 
     - Use of personal cars reimbursed at the per mile standard reimbursement rate issued by the country that the driving is taking place in.

### Process for reimbursement
Within two weeks of returning, team members should submit receipts to money@p2pu.org and enter actual expenses into the Expense Spreadsheet. For flights, e-bookings or receipts are required, and for hotel, bookings confirmations of payment are required. Any expenses beyond what were proposed will not be covered or, in some cases, need to come back to the team to be considered separately.

### Other Matters

 - When travel includes family & partners or it taken in conjunction with personal vacation time, P2PU will only cover the portion relevant to the team member and P2PU work.
 - For all organization-funded travel, team members should document their work and share a report with the team upon their return. This report should tie back to the justification originally sent for the travel.
