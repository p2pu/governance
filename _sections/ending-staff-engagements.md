## Ending staff engagements (Drafted: 9/15 Status: Draft)
### Resignation
Team members who decide to resign are requested to give at least eight weeks notice and are expected to comply with all reasonable employer expectations of them during the notice period, especially regarding handing over their workload. Upon departure, team members will lose their P2PU email address, but are invited to stay part of the virtual community. 

### End of Temporary Assignment
Contractors will be discharged when their assignment is completed. If a contractor leaves before their agreed upon task has been completed, this may result in P2PU not paying the full amount to the contractor.
