## Leaving P2PU

### Ending Staff Engagement
While the Executive Director is charged with ensuring that team member performance remains in line with the needs of the organization, any team member can bring concerns of this nature before the rest of the team, and the team should strive to implement performance improvement plans collectively. If unmet expectations escalate to a point that terminating employment becomes a plausible outcome, a call should be scheduled between 2-3 Board members, the ED, and the team member in question to discuss the issue and establish possible paths forward. In this case, performance review notes and quarterly updates will serve as the basis for discussion. While employment at P2PU is at-will, the organization strives to provide two months notice of employment termination whenever possible.

### Resignation
Team members who decide to resign are requested to give at least eight weeks notice and are expected to comply with all reasonable employer expectations of them during the notice period, especially regarding handing over their workload. Upon departure, team members will lose their P2PU email address, but are invited to stay part of the virtual community. 

### End of Temporary Assignment
Contractors will be discharged when their assignment is completed. If a contractor leaves before their agreed upon task has been completed, this may result in P2PU not paying the full amount to the contractor.
