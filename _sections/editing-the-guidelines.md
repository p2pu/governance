## Editing the Guidelines (Drafted: 3/17 Status: Proposed)
This document is generally closed to edits, but open for comments. Anybody seeking clarification of these guidelines, or desiring to change the guidelines, should first consult the team. If the team is in agreement that changes should be made, small changes, such as editing a policy for accommodate an unforeseen circumstance, can be proposed directly to the Executive Committee. Large changes, such as drafting new policies or proposing changes that contradict existing policy,  should be included in the agenda for the next Board meeting for Board approval. Furthermore, changes to any sections of this document which summarize and reference P2PU bylaws require changing the bylaws themselves; this document does not supercede P2PU bylaws.
