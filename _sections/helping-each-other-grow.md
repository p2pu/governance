## Helping each other grow
There are two formalized times each year for professional development and reflection. 

First, the team should convene in March/April to address personal growth. This conversation is geared towards understanding the long-term vision and hopes of our colleagues, and ensuring that we are doing what we can to support one another. Here are some prompts for that discussion:

#### Personal Strengths
- What activities in your job have you enjoyed the most and found most interesting? What successes do you feel you’ve had recently in your job? 
- Imagine your career 5 years from now. What are you doing? Where are you working? Who are you working with? How does it feel? Once you have a clear picture of your career, describe the steps you've taken to develop yourself professionally to get there. What have you learned? How have you learned it? With whom have you worked?

#### Development
- What areas of your career would you like to develop? What skills do you feel you need to practice more?
- Which development activity can you start on now that would be most beneficial to achieving your short-term goals? Your long-term goals? 

#### Feedback and Support
- In what ways would you like to solicit feedback about your performance? What do you need from your team to help you with your development?
- Who do you wish you knew, or what kind of people would you like to get to know, that would help you be more effective in your job?
- Do you feel connected to your local community? Are there ways that P2PU could better support you in this?

Secondly, in September/October, after the goals for the next year are set but before the budget is finalized, the team should host a meeting that is more geared towards outlining next years work. The framing for this reflection is:

- What’s exciting: What are most looking forward to working on next year?
- What do you want to learn: What are you intimidated about doing (but not dreading?)
- What’s hard: What do you dread doing?

The goal of this check-in is to assure that the goals and budget being codified for the following year are aligned with the personal goals of team members, and visa versa. This is also the time for team members to advocate for any professional development-related expenses that they would like the organization to take on for the following year.
