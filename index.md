title: Governance Guidelines
layout: page
---

At the heart of our governance model is the idea that everyone who is part of the P2PU community should be empowered to participate in the governance of the organization. The purpose of these guidelines is to create a firm basis for that intention, both documenting policies that we have arrived at in the past and projecting our principles of fairness, kindness, inclusivity, and trustworthiness towards future decision-making. The guidelines herein should not be read as a static rule book, but a generative document that grounds our thinking as a community.
